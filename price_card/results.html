          <h3>Maserati Ghibli</h3>
          <p>Sculpted forms and well-defined volumes connected by clean lines that create movement: the Ghibli captures the attention with its emphasis on sporty glamour and, just like the first Ghibli launched back in 1967, captivates with its strong personality. Notable features of the sleek silhouette include the front and rear mudguards, which merge into a single central form for a more dynamic overall line. <a href="http://media.caranddriver.com/images/13q2/511418/2014-maserati-ghibli-photo-511420-s-1280x782.jpg" target="_blank">Sponsored Link</a></p>
